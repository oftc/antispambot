Tunnelling Tor over Tor (TOT) is not only wasteful of network resources, it is
actively bad for your security. DO NOT DO IT. Doing TOT you might choose two
relays in the same /16 (i.e. in the same datacenter), thus making it easier for
an attacker to deanonymize your traffic. Doing TOT you may choose two or more
relays in the same MyFamily (i.e. operated by the same person), thus making it
easier to deanonymize you. Finally, doing TOT means your path over the Internet
is much longer, making it more likely that network-level adversaries can see
your traffic and successfully deanonymize you.
