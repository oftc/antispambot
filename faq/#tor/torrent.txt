Do not torrent over Tor. There are two reasons torrenting over Tor is bad: 1. In 2010, it was discovered that some torrent clients when configured with a socks proxy would still learn their IP address and advertise it over the proxy.  It is unknown what clients, if any, exhibit this behavior today.  2. Torrenting over Tor is overwhelmingly desired by people wanting to pirate stuff without getting
in trouble. It hogs network resources, making Tor slower for everyone including those that need it for free access to uncensored Internet. It also gets exits in trouble, thus making Tor slower and smaller network.
