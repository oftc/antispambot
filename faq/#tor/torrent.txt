Do not torrent over tor. There are two reasons torrenting over tor is bad:
1. A long while ago, it was discovered that some torrent clients when configured with a socks proxy would still learn their IP address and advertise it over their configured proxy.
It is unknown whether those clients have changed their behavior.
2. Torrenting over tor is overwhelmingly desired by people wanting to pirate stuff without getting in trouble. It hogs network resources, making Tor slower for everyone including
those that need it for free access to uncensored internet. It also gets exits in trouble, thus slower and smaller network.
