More hops does not make you more secure. Security researchers believe it is
much easier for attackers to monitor your traffic near your first "hop" and
near your last "hop" (whether they are Tor relays, VPNs, proxies, or some
mixture of things) than it is for them to go backtracking "hop by hop". It
doesn't matter how many hops or how many technologies are in the middle.
