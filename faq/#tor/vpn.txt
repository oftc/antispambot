Tunnelling Tor over a VPN is not the obvious security win you've been lead to
believe. It may even harm your security/anonymity/privacy in surprising ways.
Security experts (not VPN companies or laypeople parroting random blogs or
sponsored articles) generally advocate caution when combining Tor with a VPN
because we aren't sure it's worth it. More "hops" does not lead to more
security: experts believe it's way easier for adversaries to merely monitor the
first "hop" and last "hop" and correlate traffic, as opposed to "going hop by
hop". Lots of layers of encryption doesn't really make you safer. Be fully
informed with whatever choice you make. See these links for more anti Tor+VPN
info and ways VPNs/VPN companies aren't as great as you may think.
