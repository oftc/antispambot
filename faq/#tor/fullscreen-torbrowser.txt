Maximizing Tor Browser or making it fullscreen doesn't make your window size
more common like you might think. Every operating system (and on Linux: every
distro) has different "filler" that changes the size of a maximized window.
Consider a 1920x1080 monitor. Windows 10 users have 10 fewer vertical pixels,
macOS users have 5 fewer, Debian Gnome/KDE/LXDE have 9/7/6 fewer, etc. etc.
Literally fullscreen your browser to 1920x1080, and you'll be nearly the only
person doing that right now, so it's still not helpful.

Letterboxing was created in part to help combat this. See
