Maximizing Tor Browser or making it fullscreen doesn't make your window size
more common like you might think.  The following numbers are made up, but
illustrate why. On a 1920x1080 monitor:

Windows 10 users will have 10 fewer vertical pixels because of the start
menu bar thing;
Win 7 has 9 fewer vertical;
MacOS has 5 fewer because of the menu bar thing at the top;
Ubuntu has 10 fewer horizontal because of its dock thing;
Mint has 6 fewer vertical;
Debian Gnome has 12 fewer vertical;
Debian KDE has something different;
Debian LXDE has something different;
i3 or i3-gaps has something different and unique to them;
Anyone that literally full screens their browser with no URL bar, toolbars, or
visible tabs has exactly 1920x1080;
Someone that wants the URL bar and tabs visible while the browser is full
screen will have something different ...

The fact you have a common monitor size ends up not really helping at all.
