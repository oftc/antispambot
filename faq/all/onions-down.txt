# Most onion sites are run by amateurs and are thus going down
# temporarily/permanently all the time. This can be seemingly exacerbated by
# indexes not removing links that have been down for a significant length of
# time. If you can access "big" onion services such as Facebook's
# (https://facebookcorewwwi.onion) or DuckDuckGo's
# (http://3g2upl4pq6kufc4m.onion/), then you're very likely trying to access
# onion services that are down. There's probably nothing wrong with your
# configuration.
# 
# An index of actually good onion services:
# https://github.com/alecmuffett/real-world-onion-sites.  There's not really a
# good search engine that indexes onion services. Maybe try http://ahmia.fi.
# 
# If you've never made a search engine before, please don't try to make one for
# onion services. It won't be any better than anything that already exists.
# Instead, maybe run a relay or fix a bug or host your blog as an onion service.

# [11 Jan 2021] V3 onion service connectivity is flaky right now for everyone.
# 
# The dirauths are being overloaded with traffic such that they cannot generate a
# consensus reliably, and the behavior of v3 onion services in the presence of
# flaky consensus information (both client and server side) is buggy in ways that
# v2 onions and most other parts of Tor aren't.
# https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/tor/-/issues/40237
# 
# It is unknown if the traffic hitting the dirauths is maliciously motivated.
# There is NO evidence that the traffic overload is actively trying to hurt v3
# onions.
# 
# The deluge of traffic hitting dirauths has been happening since 6 Jan 2021
# (https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2021-January/019201.html)
# and is suspected to be similar to this situation last year
# (https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/tor/-/issues/33018).
# 
# The issue is being worked on. THE fix is likely already known, and is being
# tested by devs before getting merged and backported.
