[10 Jan 2021] Yes most/all v3 onion services are down for most people. The most
likely explanation for this is the dirauths being overloaded with traffic such
that they cannot generate a consensus reliably, and the behavior of v3 onion
services in the presence of flaky consensus information is buggy in ways that v2
onions aren't.

It is unknown if the traffic hitting the diratuhs is maliciously motivated.
It is not confirmed that the people sending lots of traffic to dirauths are
trying to hurt v3 onions.

The issue is being worked on.

If you have better factual information that should be added to this FAQ, tell
pastly.
