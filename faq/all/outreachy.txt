Hello! Welcome to this Tor IRC channel. Please be patient as IRC can be slow,
*especially* when it's not a weekday and not work-day-time for the US and
Europe.

Tor has two projects for Outreachy: Anonymous Ticket Handling [mentor Alex
(Ahf)] and Help Tor Project support our users [mentor Gus (ggus)]. Both have
instructions on the Outreachy application page.

You may also want to: (1) subscribe to relevant Tor mailing lists at
https://lists.torproject.org, (2) register an IRC account and get comfortable
with a "real" IRC client if you aren't already using one
https://support.torproject.org/get-in-touch/irc-help/, (3) create an account on
https://gitlab.torproject.org, pinging ahf or gaba on IRC after doing so.

Again, welcome and thanks for your interest in helping Tor Project! Please feel
free to stick around and ask questions.
