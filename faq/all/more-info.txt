We need more information in order to help you. Please tell us: what operating
system you're using, whether you're using Tor or Tor Browser, how you obtained
Tor (Browser), what version Tor (Browser) is.

You may be asked to share Tor (Browser) logs or your torrc configuration file.
When sharing more than 3 lines, please upload to https://paste.debian.net and
share the link. Please don't censor logs; if you do, tell us that you have.

You may be asked if your time is correct. If so, share the output of 'date -u'
in a terminal (Linux, macOS) or '[System.DateTime]::UtcNow' in powershell
(Windows). Don't include the ' quotes.
