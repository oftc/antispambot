What is this bot? Why am I voiced? What's going on?
===================================================

As an anti-spam measure, a channel that you are in has decided to configure
itself such that new people are unable to talk. A bot (me, tormodbot) saw your
messages, determined it probably isn't the below-described spam, gave you the
ability to speak, and restated your message so the rest of the channel can see
it.

There is nothing you need to do. You might want to register your nick if you
want to stick around on IRC for a while, but otherwise you're fine. Ask in
#oftc if you need help registering your nick.

I am a bot and capable of other functions. To see what else I can do, explore
this website.

For more information on the spam we're fighting, keep reading. Otherwise have a
great day.

Freenode, another IRC network like OFTC, is imploding. For information on that, see:

- https://fuchsnet.ch/freenode-resign-letter.txt

The original freenode staff have created and moved to libera.chat, and most
freenode users have followed. https://isfreenodedeadyet.com/

Someone(s) is capitalizing on this drama to spam as many channels on as many
IRC networks as possible. Their motivation is unknown.
The spam starts something like this (and gets weirder)::
